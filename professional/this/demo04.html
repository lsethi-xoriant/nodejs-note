 Fix 'this' inside closure

 Another instance when 'this' is misunderstood is when we use an inner method (a closure). It is
 important to take note that closures cannot access the outer function's this variable by using
 the 'this' keyword because the 'this' variable is accessible only by the function itself, not by
 inner functins
