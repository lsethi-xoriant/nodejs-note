<!--
 Functions are object in Javascript. And as objects, functions have methods, including the
 powerful apply, call, and bind method.On the one hand, apply and call are nearly identical
 and are frequently used in Javascript for borrowing methods and for setting the 'this' value
 explicity.We also use Apply for variable-arity functions

 While Apply and Call come with ECMAScript3 (available on IE 6,7,8, and modern browsers) added
 the Bind method.

     One problem with this example is that we are adding a new method(showData) on the cars object and
     we might not want to do that just to borrow a method because the cars object might alreay have a
     property or method name showData.We don't want to override it accidentally.it is best to borrow a method using either the Apply or Call method.
